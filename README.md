Explore the full list of supported languages and their respective codes in the [i18n folder](https://github.com/SHSharkar/gitwz/tree/main/src/i18n) of the GitWiz repository.

## **üîç Opt for `@commitlint`**

GitWiz offers the flexibility to choose your preferred style for generating commit messages. By default, it uses the `conventional-commit` format, but you can easily switch to `@commitlint` for a more structured and standardized approach.

### Switching to `@commitlint`:

1. **Set the Prompt Module**:  
   Change the prompt module to `@commitlint` using the following command:

    ```sh
    gwz config set GWZ_PROMPT_MODULE=@commitlint
    ```

    This command directs GitWiz to use `@commitlint` conventions when generating commit messages.

2. **Reverting to Default**:  
   If you wish to return to the default `conventional-commit` style, simply run:

    ```sh
    gwz config set GWZ_PROMPT_MODULE=conventional-commit
    ```

### Integrating `@commitlint` with GitWiz:

-   **Automatic Integration**:  
    The first time you run GitWiz with `GWZ_PROMPT_MODULE` set to `@commitlint`, the tool will automatically configure the integration.

-   **Manual Configuration**:  
    If you need to force reset or set the `@commitlint` configuration, use the command:

    ```sh
    gwz commitlint force
    ```

-   **Viewing Current Configuration**:  
    To check your current `@commitlint` configuration, utilize:

    ```sh
    gwz commitlint get
    ```

-   **Customization with `.gitwz-commitlint`**:  
    GitWiz creates a `.gitwz-commitlint` file in your project directory. This file contains the prompts used for the local `@commitlint` configuration, and you can edit it to fine-tune the generated commit messages according to your project's guidelines.

### Why Choose `@commitlint`?

`@commitlint` is ideal for projects that require a high level of commit message discipline and consistency. It enforces a set of rules for commit message formatting, making your commit history more readable and organized. Opting for `@commitlint` with GitWiz combines the power of AI-generated messages with the structured approach of `@commitlint`, giving you the best of both worlds.

## **üö© Git Flags: Enhanced Flexibility and Compatibility**

The `gitwz` or `gwz` commands are designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing Git workflow, offering compatibility with standard Git flags. This integration ensures that GitWiz adapts to your version control practices, enhancing them with AI-powered commit messages without altering the familiar Git command structure.

### Seamless Integration with Git Commit Flags

-   **Command Equivalence**:  
    When you use `gitwz` or `gwz`, it acts as a direct substitute for the `git commit -m` command, incorporating the generated message automatically.

    **Example**:  
    The command:

    ```sh
    gwz --no-verify
    ```

    is equivalent to:

    ```sh
    git commit -m "${generatedMessage}" --no-verify
    ```

    In this scenario, `--no-verify` or any other Git flag you use will be applied just as it is with a standard Git commit.

### Advanced Message Customization

-   **Template Functionality**:  
    GitWiz provides a template feature, allowing you to enrich the AI-generated commit message with custom text. This is especially useful for adding contextual information such as issue numbers, tags, or descriptive prefixes.

    **Usage**:  
    To prepend a custom string to your generated message, use the command:

    ```sh
    gwz 'Issue #205: $msg'
    ```

    Here, `Issue #205: ` is your custom addition, and `$msg` serves as a placeholder for the generated message.

-   **Placeholder Configuration**:  
    GitWiz analyzes placeholders within command parameters, offering flexibility in how your custom text is incorporated. You can define your preferred placeholder format in the GitWiz configuration, which will be recognized and replaced in the commit message.

    **Example**:  
    If you set your `GWZ_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER` to a simpler form like `$m`, GitWiz will use this new placeholder in processing your commit messages.

### Enhancing Your Version Control Practices

By utilizing these features, GitWiz not only maintains the core functionalities of Git but also introduces a layer of AI-enhanced efficiency and customization to your commit process. It's designed to fit smoothly into your existing Git routine, ensuring a familiar yet improved experience.

### **Message Template Placeholder Implementation**

The `Message Template Placeholder` feature in GitWiz allows you to seamlessly blend custom text with AI-generated commit messages. This functionality is particularly useful when you want to include specific tags, references, or any standardized text formats in your commits.

#### How It Works:

The underlying mechanism of this feature involves replacing a placeholder in your message template with the generated commit message. This process is handled by the following code snippet:

```javascript
commitMessage = messageTemplate.replace(config?.GWZ_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER, commitMessage);
```

In this implementation:

-   `messageTemplate` refers to the template you've set, containing the placeholder.
-   `GWZ_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER` is the configurable placeholder within your template. By default, it could be something like `$msg`.
-   The `replace` function swaps the placeholder with the actual commit message generated by GitWiz.

#### Practical Example:

If you've set your `GWZ_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER` to `$msg` and your `messageTemplate` is something like `"Fixes issue #123: $msg"`, GitWiz will replace `$msg` with the AI-generated message. So, if GitWiz generates "Updated the README for clarity", your final commit message becomes "Fixes issue #123: Updated the README for clarity".

This feature adds a layer of customization to your automated commit messages, ensuring they align with your project's or team's specific conventions or requirements.

## **üö´ Ignore Unwanted Files**

GitWiz offers a smart way to exclude specific files or directories from being processed. This is particularly useful for preventing large, irrelevant, or sensitive files from being included in the AI analysis.

### How to Set Up `.gitwzignore`:

1. **Create a `.gitwzignore` File**:  
   Just like `.gitignore`, create a `.gitwzignore` file in your project's root directory.

2. **Specify Files or Patterns**:  
   Inside this file, list the files or patterns you want GitWiz to ignore. For example:

    ```ignorelang
    # Ignore a specific file
    path/to/large-asset.zip

    # Ignore all JPG files in any directory
    **/*.jpg
    ```

3. **GitWiz Respects Your Privacy**:  
   GitWiz will automatically exclude these files from processing, ensuring that only relevant and permitted content is analyzed for commit message generation.

### Default Ignored Patterns:

By default, GitWiz is configured to ignore certain types of files to optimize performance and security. These include:

-   Lockfiles typically generated by package managers (like `*-lock.*` and `*.lock`).

### Customizing for Your Needs:

You have the flexibility to tailor the `.gitwzignore` file to suit your project's specific requirements. This ensures that GitWiz focuses only on the files that contribute meaningfully to your commit messages, while maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your repository.

## **üîó Git Hook: The Game-Changer**

Set up GitWiz as a `prepare-commit-msg` hook for seamless integration:

```sh
gwz hook set
```

Unset with ease:

```sh
gwz hook unset
```

Use it traditionally with `git commit`, or let your IDE's Source Control feature take the lead.

## **üåü GitWiz as a GitHub Action (BETA)**

Automate commit message enhancement with GitWiz, now available as a GitHub Action. This powerful feature automatically improves commit messages across all branches when you push to your remote repository.

### Setting Up GitWiz GitHub Action

1. **Create the Workflow File**:  
   Create a `.github/workflows/gitwz.yml` file in your repository to define the GitWiz action.

2. **Configure the Workflow**:  
   Use the following YAML configuration, with detailed comments for guidance:

    ```yml
    name: 'GitWiz Action'

    on:
        push:
            branches-ignore: [main, master, dev, development, release]

    jobs:
        gitwz:
            timeout-minutes: 10
            name: GitWiz
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            permissions: write-all
            steps:
                - name: Setup Node.js Environment
                  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
                  with:
                      node-version: '18'
                - uses: actions/checkout@v4
                  with:
                      fetch-depth: 0
                - uses: SHSharkar/gitwz@v4.0.10
                  with:
                      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

                  # Set up your OpenAI API key in the repository's action secrets
                  # For obtaining OpenAI keys, visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
                  # To add to your repository's secrets, navigate to: <your_repo_url>/settings/secrets/actions
                  env:
                      GWZ_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GWZ_OPENAI_API_KEY }}
                      GWZ_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS: 500
                      GWZ_OPENAI_BASE_PATH: ''
                      GWZ_DESCRIPTION: false
                      GWZ_EMOJI: false
                      GWZ_MODEL: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
                      GWZ_LANGUAGE: en
                      GWZ_PROMPT_MODULE: conventional-commit
    ```

3. **Customization**:  
   Adjust the YAML configuration to fit your project's needs. You can set branch exclusions in `branches-ignore` to avoid GitWiz rebasing commits in collaborative branches.

### Important Notes for Using GitWiz GitHub Action
