# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to our project! Your expertise and insights are invaluable to us. Here's how you can make a difference:

## Quick Start to Contribution

-   **Fork First:** Begin by forking the project repository on GitHub. This creates your own copy of the project, where you can freely experiment and make changes.

-   **Clone Your Fork:** Next, clone your forked repository to your local machine. This step is crucial for you to work on the project offline and commit your changes.

-   **Branch Out:** Before making any changes, create a new branch. This keeps your modifications organized and separate from the main project code.

-   **Commit with Care:** After implementing your changes, commit them with clear, descriptive messages. This helps everyone understand the nature and purpose of your changes.

-   **Push and Propose:** Push your changes to your forked repository. Then, create a pull request from your branch to the `dev` branch (not the `master` or `main` branch) of the original project.

## Setting Up for Success

1. **Local Copy:** Clone the project repository to your local machine. This is your workspace for all developments.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Use `npm install` to set up all necessary dependencies. This ensures that the project runs smoothly on your system.

3. **Run the Project:** Launch the project locally using `npm run dev`. This allows you to see your changes in action and test them in a live environment.

4. **Find Your Focus:** Check out [issues](https://github.com/SHSharkar/gitwz/issues) or [TODO.md](../TODO.md) for areas where the project needs help. Your contributions here are especially valuable.

## Writing Meaningful Commit Messages

-   **Automate with npm:** Use our library command `npm run dev` to generate commits. This streamlines the process and ensures consistency.
